# Genetic Algorithm Map Colouring

This is a solution to the map coloring problem using the DEAP library. The goal of the problem is to assign colors to a map such that no two adjacent regions have the same color. The solution uses the DEAP library to create a genetic algorithm that can solve the map coloring problem.
